## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources to help me complete my submisson.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge that I encountered in creating this submission was remembering as much as I could about programming in HTML and CSS
because it has been a while since I last created a program in HTML AND CSS. Most of the programs that I have created lately have
all been in Java, so it was a bit difficult to familiarize myself with the language that had to be used for this program. I overcame
this challenge by doing my best to remember how web developing works and how writing in HTML works. I was able to easily set up
the foundations of each method because of my experience with coding. I encountered another challenge while creating this program
and that was that I have never written any code in JavaScript, so I was a bit confused on how it works and what I was going to
have to do in JavaScript because I have no previous experience with it. I used some help offered to write my code for the JavaScript
part of the program and did my best to understand how it works in order for me to be able to overcome this challenge. Now that I
have finished the program, I have a better idea on how JavaScript works, one example being that it is where you create functions
that connect to your html file to make the game work in this case.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[What is it like to create a website for a big company? After graduation, I hope to work as a software engineer
so I am just curious to know what is like to be working for a big company and if developing a website for them
is in a way related to what you do in college or if it is way more harder than what you expect it to be. Do you
have spare time to spend with your family? Although this question isn't really about web development, it is a
question that I feel like is really important to ask because we all need some time to be with our family or even
just to ourselves so that we can do our favorite hobbies. Nowadays people are told to take care of their mental
health because it is very important and sometimes work strees can lay heavily on us as individuals.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time to work on this project, I would learn how to add images or figures either inside of the buttons or instead of having buttons. I believe that in doing this, it will give the game a better
looking feature that will be more attracting to players. Along with gaining more attraction, I would want this project to look as professional as I can make it look and by making the buttons look like
different figures, it would make it seem like someone was playing an actual game that can be found on the internet. Another thing that I would do is add a timer to the game to make it like a speed test, to
make it a little competitive and see how fast people can be. In adding a timer, I would also make it so that the patterns are different every time you play to make it harder and fair. With all these additions
I will have to add more functions as well as more elements to the web page. Finally, I would implement the code so that the game goes even faster as you advance further into the game, in other words, the more
times you get the pattern correct, the faster the game will go to see how fast you can keep up and remember the patterns shown.]
